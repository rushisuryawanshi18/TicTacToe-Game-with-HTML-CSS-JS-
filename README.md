Tic Tac Toe Game
A simple and interactive Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid to mark X and O, with the goal of getting three in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Features:
Interactive Game Board: Players can click on any empty cell to place their mark (X or O).
Player vs Player Mode: Two players take turns marking their moves.
Game Reset: After a game finishes (win, loss, or draw), the board can be reset to start a new game.
Responsive Design: The game board is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
Visual Feedback: Highlights the winning combination and displays a message indicating the result of the game (win, draw, or ongoing).
Tech Stack:
HTML: For the structure and layout of the game.
CSS: For styling the game board and adding visual appeal.
JavaScript: For implementing the game logic, tracking player turns, and detecting win conditions.
How to Play:
Player 1 (X) goes first, followed by Player 2 (O).
Take turns clicking on an empty cell to place your mark.
The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
